    After swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD), titles are unchanged because Java did not swap the actual references outside the method.

    After changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()), the title of jungleDVD changes to "Cinderella" because the method modified the object the reference points to.


    Why does swap not work? Because Java passes the reference by value; only local copies are swapped.

    Why does changeTitle work? Because changing the state of the object via its reference will reflect outside the method.

    Is Java pass-by-value or pass-by-reference? Java is always pass-by-value, but when passing objects, itâ€™s the value of the reference that is passed
